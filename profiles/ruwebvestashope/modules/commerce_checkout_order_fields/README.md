# Commerce checkout order

Commerce Checkout Order Fields exposes order form display modes as checkout panes, allowing you to collect additional order data during checkout.

The module provides a new checkout form view mode on orders so that at least one checkout pane is available. Customizing the form display mode will expose those fields at checkout
